                <p>What makes a interface "tick"? Even the most common devices - those that we take completely for
                    granted - rely on effective interfaces to function properly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I set out to conduct a user analysis for on of the most ubiquitous interfaces used today: the AC
                    control unit. I wanted to find out the types of users that use this interface, and to glean out the
                    major problems faced by those users.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition, I had the goal of creating a definitive set of user personas for the AC unit. This
                    would allow future designers to pinpoint the exact needs of users as they created new iterations of
                    this interface.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For this project, I observed usage of a control panel for an AC unit in private video
                    gaming/boarding gaming rooms at a community recreation center. This unit experiences heavy usage and
                    is the perfect target for conducting a user analysis study.

                <h4>User Description</h4>
                <p> Frazzled Frank is a middle-aged stay-at-home father of two.
                </p>
                <p> He has two rambunctious young children, with whom he spends much of his
                    time with and frequently takes out for activities at the local recreation center and other
                    kid-friendly locations.
                </p>
                <h4>Interface Problems</h4>
                <p> Frank finds the interface very manual and tedious to use. He finds that he
                    must step through multiple steps to accomplish his objectives, and finds doing so difficult
                    while taking care of his children.
                </p>
                <p> Frank finds the buttons on the interface hard to press, as they are manual
                    (not capacitive) buttons that require a fair amount of force.
                </p>
                <p> Frank finds it annoying that the buttons on the interface must be
                    repeatedly pressed to increment the settings (i.e changing the temperature by 5 degrees requires
                    5 separate button pushes).
                </p>
                <p> Frank has a bit of trouble reading the small font sizes on the controls of
                    the device and viewing the light that reflects user selections.

                <h4>User Selection Explanation</h4>
                <p> According to Census.gov, 61.6% of men in America are fathers, and about
                    50% classify as middle-aged (early thirties to early sixties) representing a very large user
                    base for the product.
                </p>
                <p> Frank was chosen as a persona as he encapsulates a very large slice of
                    users who all exhibit similar behavior drawn upon similar life experiences and similar familial
                    dynamics.
                </p>
                <p> Frank represents the classic archetype of a middle-aged individual in
                    America. He has experience with and is fully capable of using older interfaces (as these
                    individuals have lived through and used technology of the last several decades), but much
                    prefers the ease of use associated with newer designs.
                </p>
                <p> Frank exhibits this familiarity when he quickly and efficiently tunes the
                    AC to fit his needs.
                </p>
                <p> Frank represents users who are busy, distracted, and prefer quick-response
                    interfaces that can adapt quickly using the latest tools available.

                    school.
                </p>
                <p> Amy grew up in the age of technology, and is familiar with the newest innovations. She doesn’t have
                    a ton of responsibilities on her plate, and enjoys hanging out with her friends (especially at her
                    local community recreation center).
                </p>
                <h4>Interface Problems</h4>
                <p> Amy finds the interface very manual and unintuitive. She has difficulty understanding how all the
                    settings tie together, and how they should be used to achieve her desired temperature.
                </p>
                <p> Amy has a hard time pressing the buttons, and finds them clunky and unresponsive to her actions. She
                    also finds the coloring distasteful.
                </p>
                <p> Amy doesn’t like how the buttons require separate pushes to increment (i.e, one needs to press the
                    “down” button five separate times to adjust the temperature down by 5 degrees).
                </p>
                <p> Amy has a difficult time reading the light that indicates what setting the unit is on, especially in
                    the brightly lit room.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Amy wishes the interface did not require so much close-up interaction, and could be controlled from
                    farther away.

                <h4>User Selection Explanation</h4>
                <p> According to Statista, Gen Z (those born in the mid 90’s to mid 2000’s) make up 21% of the
                    population.
                </p>
                <p> These individuals represent the next generation of frequent UI users, and interfaces must able to
                    satisfy their needs to be viable.
                </p>
                <p> Amy represents the archetypal Gen Z individual; She is very well-versed in technology, has an innate
                    understanding of how the newest touch and voice based UIs work, and has spent nearly the entirety of
                    her life in the midst of the technological revolution.
                </p>
                <p> Amy has a somewhat limited understanding of dated technology, and finds UI’s based on concepts from
                    earlier decades a bit more difficult to use given her lack of experience.
                </p>
                <p> Amy has a larger social network, and is often found in communal places where this AC interface is
                    located in.

                    Users tend to crave automation and automatic features in appliances. It appears that even older
                    individuals have learned how to use the newer technologies, and actively seek out these technologies
                    that reduce interface usage time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Resistive style touch buttons tend to be uniformly disliked by users. Users have grown accustomed to
                    the capacitive touch screen style, and oftentimes will not press hard enough on older interfaces to
                    elicit a response.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I found very surprising the amount of overlap in usage patterns between individuals with large
                    age-gaps. Even with vastly different backgrounds and experiences, there are many commonalities in
                    the features that users actively seek out.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What we anticipate will be problems with real users often doesn't match up with reality. It's really
                    important to actually carry out interviews and real-world observations to get an unbiased
                    understanding of what works and what doesn't.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Overall, I really enjoyed this project. I gained a new-found appreciation for the persona-creation
                    and storyboarding process, and look forward to applying these skills towards upcoming design
                    challenges.
