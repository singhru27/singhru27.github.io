                <p>For any business, creating and ensuring that products are well-received and well-liked by users is
                    always a top priority. Failing to adapt and meet the wants and needs of consumers can lead to
                    backlash (in the case of the recent new Google suite icon rollout) or even rapid loss of users
                    (MySpace).
                </p>
                <p>
                    One of the most effective ways to conduct user research before actually deploying interface changes
                    is A/B testing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A/B testing involves a randomized experiment, in which users are presented two slightly different
                    versions of the exact same interface. Metrics such as time to completion (how long the user takes to
                    complete a task) and return rate (how often the user returns to a landing page) are measured for
                    each version.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After collecting the data, statistical tests are conducted to determine whether the difference leads
                    to statistically significant results.

                    For this project, I investigated a series of changes to a basic shopping cart website. This kind of
                    website is used by hundreds of thousands of businesses, and user retention is key for the success
                    for many small businesses (especially as the world transitions to a primarily online shopping
                    society). The two website iterations are listed below.

                                products (since they are all vertically aligned), and also makes adding together the

                                calculations
                                of total prices (which makes a difference, since customers are instructed to add at

                                $150 of items)

                                Comparatively, Website B is laid out in horizontal fashion and prices aren't
                                as easily compared (since they come at the end of text strings that require reading).
                                This may
                                lead the user to need to go back and forth from the checkout page to the current page,

                <p> Perhaps one of the biggest takeaways from this project was that
                    conducting tests with high power and low chance of statistical error requires a large volume of
                    data.
                    With this project we were fortunate to have such extreme results that we were able to reject the
                    null with only 25 samples, but it required a nearly 66% difference in means between the two
                    groups - a number that may be difficult to reach.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Scan patterns are crucially important towards improving the user experience (and specifically
                    user efficiency). Action buttons placed at the end of user scan patterns resulted in a
                    difference of nearly 7 seconds for time to completion.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The results of this test may be limited in its generalizability because of the skewed sample on
                    which it was conducted. Online cacti buyers are most likely not 20 year old college students -
                    having a sample representative of the true population is crucial for obtaining proper results.
                </p>
                <p>
                    AB Testing tends to perform at its best when it is conducted on unassuming users (i.e natural
                    browsers of a website who don't even know that a test is being conducted). When individuals are
                    told that they are being tested, it appears that they become hyperaware of their actions and may
                    change their behavior.
